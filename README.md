Playground for algorithms in JavaScript.
This is a child project of [@aureooms/js-library](https://github.com/make-github-pseudonymous-again/js-library)
and
the twin project of [@aureooms/js-data-structures](https://github.com/make-github-pseudonymous-again/js-data-structures).

Those packages aim to provide *code bricks* that are as generic as possible.
Some examples are a Gauss-Jordan method that can work with any number model, a
Karatsuba algorithm that can handle any input size, a Graham Scan algorithm
that works with clockwise or counter clockwise ordering, and a Monotone Chain
algorithm that can be used as a triangulation algorithm without any change.
